## Project Overview

The E-Learning Platform is a modern, responsive, and interactive frontend web application designed to provide users with a smooth online learning experience. This project focuses on course exploration, video-based learning, progress tracking, and user-friendly navigation, all implemented using core web technologies. The platform allows learners to browse courses, watch embedded video lectures, track their learning progress, and manage their profile

This project is ideal for demonstrating frontend development skills, UI/UX design understanding, DOM manipulation, and browser-based data storage using localStorage.

 ## Key Features

- Multi-page layout  using JavaScript

- Course listing and search functionality

- Embedded YouTube video lectures

- Learning progress tracking

- User profile with completed progress

- Dark mode toggle

- Modern glassmorphism UI design



## Tools & Technologies Used
### Frontend Technologies

- HTML5:
Used for structuring the entire application, including header navigation, sections (Home, Courses, Profile), and semantic layout.

- CSS3:
Used for styling the platform with:

  - Glassmorphism UI

  - Gradient backgrounds

  - Hover animations and transitions

  - Responsive grid layouts

  - Dark mode support

- JavaScript
Used to add interactivity and application logic such as:

  - Page navigation without reload

  - Course rendering dynamically

  - Search filtering

  - Video loading

  - Progress tracking

  - Local storage management

  - Dark mode toggle

## Platform & Environment

- Platform: Web Browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

- Development Environment: Any code editor (VS Code recommended)

- No backend required

- No external frameworks or libraries used
  
- Uses YouTube embedded videos as learning content



## Project Structure
E-Learning-Platform

 - index.html      → Main HTML structure
 - style.css       → Complete UI styling and animations
 - script.js       → Application logic and interactivity

## Courses Included

The platform currently includes frontend and backend courses such as:

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

- React JS

- Python Programming

- Java Programming

Each course includes:

- Category tag (Frontend / Backend)

- Embedded YouTube video

- Progress percentage (stored locally)

## Progress Tracking

The platform uses browser localStorage to store learning progress.
Each time a user completes a lesson:

- Progress increases by 25%

- Data persists even after page refresh

- Profile section displays only started courses

- Progress bars visually represent completion



## Dark Mode

A dark mode feature is included to enhance accessibility and user comfort.
Users can toggle between light and dark themes instantly, improving usability in low-light environments.



## How to Run the Project

1.Download or clone the repository

2.Open index.html in any modern web browser

3.No installation or server setup required

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped in strengthening:

- HTML structure and semantics

- Advanced CSS styling and animations

- JavaScript DOM manipulation

- State management using localStorage

- UI/UX design principles
